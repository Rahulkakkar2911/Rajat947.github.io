				<p>I	gathered	up	all	my	possessions,	sold	them	or	put	them	into	storage,

fashioned	 adventure-seeking.	 But	 there	 also	 existed	 a	 faint	 outline	 of	 shame
underlying	 everything	 else.	 At	 the	 time	 I	 was	 hardly	 aware	 of	 it,	 but	 if	 I	 was
completely	 honest	 with	 myself,	 I	 knew	 there	 was	 a	 screwed-up	 value	 lurking
there,	 somewhere	 beneath	 the	 surface.	 I	 couldn’t	 see	 it,	 but	 in	 quiet	 moments

twenty-five-year-old	adventure-seeker,	it	was	exactly	what	I	wanted	out	of	life.
But	as	sexy	and	heroic	as	my	plan	sounded,	not	all	of	the	values	driving	me
to	this	nomadic	lifestyle	were	healthy	ones.	Sure,	I	had	some	admirable	values
going	on—a	thirst	to	see	the	world,	a	curiosity	for	people	and	culture,	some	old-
fashioned	 adventure-seeking.	 But	 there	 also	 existed	 a	 faint	 outline	 of	 shame
underlying	 everything	 else.	 At	 the	 time	 I	 was	 hardly	 aware	 of	 it,	 but	 if	 I	 was
completely	 honest	 with	 myself,	 I	 knew	 there	 was	 a	 screwed-up	 value	 lurking
there,	 somewhere	 beneath	 the	 surface.	 I	 couldn’t	 see	 it,	 but	 in	 quiet	 moments

left	 my	 apartment,	 and	 set	 off	 for	 Latin	 America.	 By	 this	 time	 my	 little	 dating
advice	blog	was	getting	some	traffic	and	I	was	actually	making	a	modest	amount
of	money	selling	PDFs	and	courses	online.	I	planned	on	spending	much	of	the
next	few	years	living	abroad,	experiencing	new	cultures,	and	taking	advantage	of
the	lower	cost	of	living	in	a	number	of	developing	countries	in	Asia	and	Latin
